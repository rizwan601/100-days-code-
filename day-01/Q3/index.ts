// Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
// "Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"
console.log('Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”')


//  2: Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 1, but this tiQuestionme store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person.
//  Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

// Explain & TIP: First, save the author's name in a variable. Next, create your quote message in another variable. 
//Then, show it. This teaches you to organize and use your data with variables.

let Name3: string ="Albert "
let quote: string ="“A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”"
console.log(`${Name3} Einstein once said ${quote}`)


//Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
//Use "\t" (tab) and "\n" (new line) at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
//Then print the name after stripping the white spaces.

let Name2:string="\t\n Asharib \t\n";;
console.log(Name2);
console.log(Name2.trim());
